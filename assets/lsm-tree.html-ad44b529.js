Operations are provided to look up the value associated with a specified key, and to iterate over all key/value pairs in a specified key range. Internally, each SSTable contains a sequence of blocks (typically each block is 64KB in size, but this is configurable). A block index (stored at the end of the SSTable) is used to locate blocks; the index is loaded into memory when the SSTable is opened. A lookup can be performed with a single disk seek: we first find the appropriate block by performing a binary search in the in-memory index, and then reading the appropriate block from disk. Optionally, an SSTable can be completely mapped into memory, which allows us to perform lookups and scans without touching disk.")],-1),p=e("figure",null,[e("img",{src:r,alt:"",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"}),e("figcaption")],-1),h=e("p",null,"完整 lsm-tree 图",-1),u=e("figure",null,[e("img",{src:i,alt:"",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"}),e("figcaption")],-1),m=[n,c,d,p,h,u];function b(_,f){return s(),o("div",null,m)}const y=t(l,[["render",b],["__file","lsm-tree.html.vue"]]);export{y as default};
